# Resume
A personal resume introducing myself, highlighting my background, interests, and skills. 
Resumes, in my opinion, have become rather bland in the past couple of years. With the introduction of AI and how that can be used to read and sort resumes, the primary focus has been to use the right words and follow the right type and layout, not on highlighting your skills and why you are right for the job. My goal with the resume I drafted through Claude.ai was to bring back some personality and creativity while highlighting my skills. The hardest part of this project was finding the balance between over-the-top design and boring. My initial draft was black and white and looked like every resume template on the market. I went further with my next draft and incorporated a bit of pink. My final draft included low-opacity mountains in the background to show my personality without taking away from the key components of the resume. When I handed in another version of this resume that I crafted using Illustrator, the employer I gave it to appreciated the creativity that went into it, which boosted my confidence that not every resume has to look like the same black and white template found on the web.
